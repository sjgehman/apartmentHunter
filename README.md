This script is designed to scrape the website of a popular Evanston apartment building and send you an email when it finds apartments that match your price and bedroom requirements.

I used it so that I could be first to apply for my desired apartment, and it's quite handy. You can set up your machine to run main.py at frequent intervals so that you get alerts as soon as a new listing hits the market.

To use this script, simply edit the price and number of bedrooms at the top of apartment_finder.py and change the email sender/receiver in email_notifications.py. It will not run off the shelf because there is currently no email set in email_notifications.py
